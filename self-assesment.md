# Professional Self-Assessment

## My Growth in Computer Science
This capstone project was a great way to bring together everything I’ve learned. My project, a **React.js War Card Game**, allowed me to apply **software engineering, algorithms, and databases** in a real-world application.

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
One of the biggest challenges was **debugging database authentication issues**. Even though I didn’t fix them completely, I learned **backend development and troubleshooting**.

## How This Applies to My Career
This project helped me gain more confidence in **full-stack development**. Moving forward, I plan to improve my **backend skills**, especially with databases and authentication.
