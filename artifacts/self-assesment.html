    <h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
    
    <p>
        Over the course of my Computer Science degree, I have gained valuable experience in 
        software engineering, algorithms, data structures, and databases. This capstone project 
        has allowed me to showcase my growth and apply what I have learned to a real-world project. 
        My final project, a React.js-based War Card Game, demonstrates my ability to build, enhance, 
        and optimize a web application while incorporating industry best practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Takeaways from the Capstone Project</h2>
    
    <p>
        Working on this project helped me refine my development process and understand how various 
        aspects of computer science come together to create a complete software application. Some 
        of the key areas I focused on include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Software Engineering & Design:</strong> Improved React component structure, implemented animations, and optimized the game logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithms & Data Structures:</strong> Implemented an efficient shuffle algorithm using Fisher-Yates and developed tie-breaker mechanics.</li>
        <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Designed a PostgreSQL database to store player statistics, including wins and losses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges Faced and Lessons Learned</h2>
    
    <p>
        One of the biggest challenges I faced was implementing a backend that could store and retrieve 
        player data efficiently. Initially, I encountered authentication errors when setting up the 
        PostgreSQL database, which required me to debug and adjust user permissions. Another challenge 
        was ensuring the frontend properly displayed the retrieved data and updated it dynamically 
        based on game outcomes.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Through this process, I learned how to troubleshoot backend issues, improve API error handling, 
        and structure my database to support scalable applications.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Goals</h2>

    <p>
        Moving forward, I plan to refine my skills further in full-stack development, focusing on 
        advanced front-end frameworks like Next.js and backend optimizations using Node.js and databases. 
        Additionally, I am interested in exploring cloud computing and DevOps to gain experience 
        in deploying and managing web applications at scale.
