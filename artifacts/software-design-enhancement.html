    <h1>Software Design & Engineering Enhancement</h1>

    <p>
        In this enhancement, I focused on improving the structure and performance of my React.js-based
        War Card Game. The primary goal was to ensure that the code was modular, scalable, and easy
        to maintain while also improving the user experience through visual enhancements.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes Implemented</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Component Refactoring:</strong> Broke down large components into smaller, reusable ones for better
            maintainability.</li>
        <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Optimized state updates to reduce unnecessary re-renders and improve
            performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Animations:</strong> Added smooth card flipping animations using Framer Motion to improve the game's
            visual appeal.</li>
        <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> Improved click event handlers for better game interaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>

    <p>
        One of the major challenges was managing game state updates effectively without causing UI
        flickering or unnecessary re-renders. I solved this by using Reactâ€™s `useState` and
        `useEffect` efficiently, ensuring that only necessary components were updated.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, implementing animations required adjusting component layouts to avoid overlap
        issues when cards were flipped during gameplay. I refined the styling to maintain a clean
        and engaging user interface.
    </p>

    <h2>Impact of These Enhancements</h2>

    <p>
        These improvements made the game feel more polished and user-friendly. The refactored code
        is easier to maintain, and the animations enhance player engagement. These changes demonstrate
        my ability to structure applications effectively while optimizing the user experience.
