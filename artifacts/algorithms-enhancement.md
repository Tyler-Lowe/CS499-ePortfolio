# Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement

## What I Enhanced
I improved the gameâ€™s shuffle algorithm by implementing **Fisher-Yates shuffle** and added **tie-breaker logic**.

## Why I Chose This Enhancement
This showcases my ability to **optimize algorithms and game mechanics**.

## Challenges I Faced
- Debugging **tie-breaker logic** to prevent infinite loops.
- Ensuring **fairness in card distribution**.

## What I Learned
- How to implement **better shuffle algorithms**.
- How to manage **game state efficiently**.
