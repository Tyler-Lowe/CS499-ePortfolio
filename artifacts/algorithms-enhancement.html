    <h1>Algorithms & Data Structures Enhancement</h1>

    <p>
        This enhancement focused on optimizing the game logic, particularly the shuffle algorithm and
        handling tie-breaker scenarios more effectively.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes Implemented</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Optimized Shuffle Algorithm:</strong> Replaced the default shuffle function with the Fisher-Yates
            algorithm for better randomness.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Deck Management:</strong> Implemented a queue system to manage deck operations more
            effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Tie-Breakers:</strong> Refactored logic to handle consecutive ties properly and ensure fair
            card distribution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>

    <p>
        One challenge was ensuring that the shuffle algorithm maintained fairness across different
        game sessions. By implementing Fisher-Yates, I improved the randomization quality compared
        to the standard sort-based shuffle.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another issue was resolving tie-breaker scenarios effectively. Initially, the game would
        sometimes enter an infinite loop due to unresolved ties. By restructuring the tie-breaking
        logic, I ensured that tied cards were properly redistributed without breaking the game flow.
    </p>

    <h2>Impact of These Enhancements</h2>

    <p>
        These enhancements made the game more fair and competitive. The optimized shuffle ensures
        randomness, while the new tie-breaker logic prevents unfair advantages. This demonstrates my
        understanding of algorithms and how they affect game mechanics.
